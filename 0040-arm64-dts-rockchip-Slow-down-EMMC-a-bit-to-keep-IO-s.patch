Subject: [PATCH 40/77] arm64: dts: rockchip: Slow down EMMC a bit to keep IO
 stable

This drops to hs200 mode and 150Mhz as this is actually stable across
eMMC modules. There exist some that are incompatible at higher rates
with the rk3588 and to avoid your filesystem corrupting due to IO
errors, be more conservative and reduce the max. speed.
