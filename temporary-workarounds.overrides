# This file is for temporary workarounds (e.g. disabling 3rd party
# modules until they've been ported). Keeping them in a separate
# file rather than modifying the original configs makes it easier to
# keep track of what needs to be fixed and to restore the original
# functionality.

# Disable VirtualBox modules until they've been ported to 6.19 upstream
